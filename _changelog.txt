At this point, my changelogs were mostly kept with github.
Past here is what I'm adding as of today.
I began on this 4/1, when the code was initially leaked.
Further down is an overview of current changes from what the game was during Ray's hosting.

Gamemode/Map redone:
	The vision is shifted from the town to the wilderness, with only a small village being provided.
	There's a major emphasis on exploration, as time goes on I'm adding more things to find, and loot boxes are much more lucrative.
	There are now 5 areas:
		Sherwoods:
			*Many roles spawn here
			*There's a small village with many amenities and shops
			*Safe from ambushes during the day time.
			*West side of the map.
		Bog:
			*Goblins spawn at a cave here.
			*Venemous beespiders can spawn in an ambush here.
			*South side of the map.
		Mount Decapitation:
			*Nobody spawns here, and it's easy to get isolated and lost here.
			*Higher ambush chance than other places.
			*North side of the map.
		Nightman's Manor:
			*Nightman, grabber, and younker spawn here.
			*Far North side of the map.
		Wyrld:
			*Adventurers and pilgrims have a high chance to spawn here.
			*Dangerous, full of traps and monsters.
			*Many treasures await the player.
			*Central to the other areas.

Many systems added/revamped:
	Client:
		*crafting recipe added to memory tab of lobby
		*quick guides for alchemy and enchanting added to memory tab too
		*very basic lore, allowing the players to mold the world to their desire

	Roles:
		*No role is "essential" for gameplay purposes.
		*The village is unowned, and keys can be found for the various doors.
		*Adventurer tends to spawn farther from the village.

	Combat:
		*silver weapons can be crafted, but are very brittle
		*bleed is much slower
		*critical hits are less effective
		*unarmed is viable, and if you have bracers you can parry
		*warrior monks, an adventurer class, has the ability to reflect all projectiles
		*fire is not as deadly

	Spells:
		*greater fireball has been removed
		*arcane heal has been added to mages, to heal yourself and others
		*runes can be found in loot boxes or while mining, these teach you various spells- and are used in enchanting and alchemy

	Miracles
		*miracles are based on your patron
			**If you're familiar with the previous gods: Psydon encompasses many of them, Saradomin parallels Necra & Noc, Guthix parallels Dendor, and Zamorak is a pure evil force of nature.
		*every monk has some form of healing
		*healing spells cure disease

	Disease:
		*disease adds another layer of difficulty to survival.
		*any wound that causes you to bleed adds to your disease rate.
		*wounds can be treated through miracles, rest, or ashes.
		*when enough disease builds up in your character, you'll contract a disease.
		*these diseases have a major impact on your stats, varying depending on the disease.
		*diseases are difficult to remove, requiring a blessing from a monk or a cure disease potion.

	Mood:
		*stress has a major impact on your character's ability to learn/fight
		*character flaw will tank your mood, and cause heart attacks, if untended

	Alchemy:
		*quick guide in memory tab
		*cauldrons are used to create various potions
		*mortar and pestles can break down certain items
		*many new potions, for boosting stats and curing disease, have been added

	Enchanting:
		*quick guide in memory tab
		*Many steel and silver weapons can be enchanted.
		*Enchantments provide various enhancements to your weapon.

	Kingdoms:
		*ported from civ13
		*An icon appears above your character for easy identification

	Antagonists:
		*Villian selection removed, and is no longer random.
		*The various antagonists can be accessed by setting your patron to "Zamorak"
		*Skeletons added
		*Goblins added

	Patron:
		*Loosely represents your character's alignment.
		*Descriptions of all patron's appear upon selection.
		*Many roles are dependant on your patron.
