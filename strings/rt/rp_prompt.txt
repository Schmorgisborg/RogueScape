(Welcome to RogueScape)<br>
Currently, it is the Fourth Age.
<br><br>
Many years ago, a powerful sorcerer devouted his entire existence to the study and spread of religion. Eventually, Psydon tapped into a new type of power: miracles. He taught many of these miracles, wrought from the devotion of the followers of the divine. This newfound power led to a golden age, but there were many jealous of such power, who sought to take it for their own. Zizo was the most prominent of their leaders, worshipping not the Gods but their own desire for power.
<br>
After many years of fighting, the war between Psydon and Zizo has been lost, and Psydon slain. With the last of his remaining power, Psydon tore open a rift, and cast the remaining loyal followers into a new land. The shaman-God Guthix guided the lost into this new dangerous land, and Saradomin continues to reap the souls lost.
<br><br>
This new place, known as Wyrld, is full of danger and mostly untouched. Zizo's influence cannot reach this land, and even in death Psydon's power flows throughout the world.
<br><br>
Humanity, at the brink of destruction, must create a home in this place given to them by Psydon. Will you go down in legend or falter into obscurity this day?
